# Check-in-1
* I chose to implement the firebase db complexity
  * A user can create a new account and use it to sign into the app
  * The sign-up screen ensures passwords match and account does not already exist
    * Later I'll make sure passwords are strong
  * Log-in screen logs you in if email and password are correct
  * I'll use FB to store a user's recent restaurant choices and custom preferences later
    * setup the recyclerView for the recent picks fragment
* I also set up a large part of the home screen fragment
  * Only UI components are set up


# CSCI 4237 - Project 2 - BYOI
Bring Your Own Idea!

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Create a new folder inside of your cloned repo (e.g. like "Project1").
3. Create a new Android Studio project (min SDK version of API 23). During the initial project setup, set the Save location to the new folder that you just created (e.g. so you can commit your project back into this repo).
  - **If you are extending Project 1**, you can instead copy your project files into this repo and push them up. You'll need to do this if working in pairs so your partner can access them (in addition to possibly sharing API keys). If you're working individually, I'd still ask you do this for organization's sake for grading.
4. Use git to add, commit, and push your new project to the `main` branch - now you have your starting point set locally and on GitHub! You are now ready to get started.
5. Don't forget to branch before you create commits - you'll need to create Pull Requests for the major project deliverables.
